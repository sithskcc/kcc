          <h2>Who are we?</h2>
          <p>
            The Korean Culture Club, commonly known as KCC. To students who enjoy dancing, this club is for you! Our KCC leaders learn dances of various genres (more often than not k-pop, but we have explored traditional and hip-hop styles before) and teach it to students throughout the year. We perform in both the Multicultural and Asian Pacific American Heritage Month (APAHM) shows! As a club, we strive to celebrate Korean culture through the arts, showcase our talents, form friendships as we go along, and more importantly, have fun! Anyone and everyone is welcome to join.
          </p>
